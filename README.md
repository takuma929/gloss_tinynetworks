## 2. Installation Guide

1. Download the repository:
   [https://github.com/takuma929/gloss\_tinynetworks](https://github.com/takuma929/gloss_tinynetworks)
   or clone with git:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/takuma929/gloss_tinynetworks.git
   ```

2. Open MATLAB and set the repository root directory as your working directory.

3. Add all subfolders to the MATLAB path.

## 3. Demo: Generate All Figures

To generate all figures and process the data as in the manuscript:

1. Start MATLAB and navigate to the main project folder.

2. Run the following command in the MATLAB Command Window:

   ```
   main
   ```

3. All figures will be saved to the `figs/` directory, and cleaned data files will be saved in the `data/` directory.

**Expected Output:**

* PDF and PNG files for all main and supplementary figures
* Cleaned MATLAB data files (e.g., `onlineData.mat`)

**Typical install & run times:**

* Setup: less than 1 minute (copy/unzip files and MATLAB path setup)
* Data download: repository (with datasets) is > 6 GB (download time depends on your internet speed)
* Expected run time: \~5–10 minutes on a standard computer

## 4. Instructions for Use

* To run individual figure scripts or customize analyses:

  * Each figure has its own script (e.g., `fig3_model_comparison.m` for Figure 3).
  * Prepare the data first by running `process_onlinedata.m`.
  * You can run any script individually after data preparation.

* Reproducing results in the manuscript:

  * Running `main.m` will reproduce all results and figures as reported in the paper.

* The scripts are modular; you can adapt or extend the analyses as needed.

## 7. Software Description and Documentation

* **Key operations:**
  The software processes behavioral and computational model response data, applies exclusion criteria, computes summary statistics, and generates all figures in the manuscript.

* **Fundamental tasks:**
  Raw data processing, model evaluation, analysis, and figure generation for publication.

* **Algorithms and approach:**
  Standard psychophysical data processing, correlation analysis, kernel fitting, t-SNE visualization, and comparison of model predictions with human perception.

* **Dependencies:**
  Only standard MATLAB toolboxes required. Other dependencies are included in the `function` directory.
